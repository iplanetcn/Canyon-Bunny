* The list of actors are as follows:

  * Rocks will be serving as platforms for the player character and items
  * Canyons in the background (for level decoration)

 ### Description of the game
 
 The game world is presented in a 2D-side view to the player. The view will scroll horizontally to the right-hand side when the player character moves forward. The background shows distant canyons and clouds in the sky. The bottom of the level is flled with water and will instantly kill the player character if both get in touch with each other.
 
 The player character will move on and jump over to random rocks, sticking out of the water. The width and height will be different to make the game more challenging. The player is only in control of a jump button, which will keep the automatically forwardmoving player character from falling down into the deadly water.
 
 The level will be randomly populated with collectible items consisting of gold coins and feather power-ups. Collecting the gold coins will increase the player's high score. The feather power-up grants the player character the ability to ﬂy for a limited time and can be used by repeatedly pressing the jump button. The player's goal is to beat the last high score.
